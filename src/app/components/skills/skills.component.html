        <p>My main role in software development is to be a FrontEnd developer. I have 3+ years of experience building
          web applications that run on the client side.</p>
        <p>I use angular as my daily main web framework and I have extensive knowledge and understanding of how it works.
          I know how to work under a model of modules and components, I understand and master the reactive programming
          approach with the use of observables, promises, subscriptions among other RxJS's operators.</p>
        <p>I have strong bases in the use of most of its components such as: CLI, change detection, pipes, directives,
          services, components, modules, models, lifecycle hooks, reactive forms, routing and navigation, lazy loading,
          animations, http client's request, request interceptors, inputs, outputs, eventEmitters, render2, viewChild,
          ElementRef, hostListeners, guards, dynamic component loadings, testing (with karma and jasmine), etc.</p>
        <p>In addition to Angular, I have excellent skills, knowledge and I have had the opportunity to work in tools
          and technologies such as: JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS/SCSS, bootstrap, Angular Material, Angular
          FlexLayout, FontAwesome, Mapbox, Zeplin, Invision, Figma, among others.</p>

        <h1 class="display-5 pb-3">Mobile skills</h1>
        <p>Whenever I work on a web page, I take it as a mandatory task to build and design it following a responsive
          design so that it can be used on desktop devices, tablets and mobile devices. With that in mind, I have had
          the opportunity to build and work with PWAs.</p>
        <p>Leaving aside PWAs and responsive web pages, I have experience and good knowledge in building hybrid mobile
          applications for Android and iOS using the IONIC framework, making use of native device resources such as camera, internal storage,
          GPS, etc. I also I know how to make HTTP requests to API Rest servers, how to create pages and navigate between
          them passing parameters, how to use modals, tabs, toolbars, toast, customize the splash screen and the
          notification bar, promises, implement services or providers, among others.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, I have basic knowledge of Java to build native Android applications. Despite not being my
          strong suit, I know the basics in the handling of List, Grid, Card and Recycler views, tabs, toolbars, and the
          different layouts.</p>

          such as development and release (GitFlow) or in flows built in Trunk Based Development.</p>
        <p>I have supported applications in a production environment under the standby model, I have management and
          knowledge of how to proceed in fixing an incident in a production environment through hotfix and its subsequent
          patch to pre-production environments through cherry-picks.</p>
